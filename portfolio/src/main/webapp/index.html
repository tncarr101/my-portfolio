     <h3> Where am I from? </h3>
      <p> Greeting and Salutations! I am Toni! Whenever I am asked who am I, this is always a hard question. Well... I am originally from
          Tacoma, Washington which is about 35 minutes outside of Seattle. This is where my Pacific Northwest roots stem start. I currently
          reside in Charlotte, NC where I have lived for about 9 years. Living here, I have picked up a little southern hospitality. I enjoy
          spending time with my family and friends, staying active, and being outside.
